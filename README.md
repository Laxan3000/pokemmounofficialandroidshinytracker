# Unofficial Android Shiny Tracker for PokéMMO

This is actually my first real app I made (for myself mainly) with Sketchware Pro,

This app can be used to keep track of encounters for shiny hunting, payday, amulet coin farm and more (even if it was made just for shiny hunting)

You can use this Tool for both PokéMMO Android and Desktop (by using popup or main mode)

If you will to help me developing by installing the app and trying it out, maybe suggesting new features or else, you would do me a favor, and I will thank you for that.

I actually am planning to make this open source, but I still don't know how.
